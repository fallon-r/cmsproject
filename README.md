# cmsproject

For this project, I was making a node CLI that would allow the user to view and manage different departments of an imaginary organization. It uses require. To add some flair, I came up with a fake name (MoneyCorp) and used Figlet as well as chalk to make a welcome screen that has some ascii art. There's a slight bit of validation in the beginning (the employee must agree to the super user agreement anyone that's used bash is familiar with.)


I did not finish setting up the seed file and need to revisit the server-side logic that actually writes to the DB. I also need to flesh out the questions, as their relevant functions are not currently completed.
